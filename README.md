# Formal languages and Automata Theory
This repository contains the code I worked on for my CS112 course. During the laboratoy I worked on DFA, NFA, and regular expressions. The code is written in Python and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.
<br>
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Open the script in your favorite IDE or text editor, and run the run.py file. The code is well-commented, so you can easily understand how it works.

This repository contains the .py files and some examples you can verify with the ending corespponding to the .py name.
